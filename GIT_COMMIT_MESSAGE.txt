commit -m "Fix: Resolve UTF-8 BOM encoding, DataSource Type attribute, and RPT parsing errors

FIXES ALL 3 CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. UTF-8 BOM Encoding ✅
   - Changed from Encoding.UTF8 to UTF8Encoding(true) to include BOM (EF BB BF)
   - Files: RDLBuilder.cs, RdlPreviewForm.cs, MainForm.cs, CrystalReportParser.cs
   - Added automatic BOM verification after file save
   - Resolves SSRS error: 'Unicode byte order mark is missing'

2. DataSource Type Attribute ✅
   - Removed empty Type=\"\" attribute from DataSource element
   - File: RDLBuilder.cs CreateDataSources() method
   - SSRS now correctly deserializes RDL files
   - Resolves SSRS error: 'Type attribute is not allowed'

3. RPT Parsing Failures ✅
   - Added retry logic (3 attempts, 100ms delay) for file loading
   - Comprehensive null checking throughout parsing
   - Proper exception handling and logging
   - File: CrystalReportParser.cs
   - Resolves intermittent parsing errors

ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS:

- Added XML declaration: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>
- A4 page format support (8.5\" x 11\")
- Individual field display in report layout
- User feedback messages for all save operations
- Console logging for debugging

DOCUMENTATION ADDED:

- FINAL_SUMMARY.md - Complete overview
- DATASOURCE_TYPE_FIX.md - Type attribute issue details
- UTF8_BOM_FIX_README.md - Quick start guide
- UTF8_BOM_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md - Technical deep-dive
- Plus 4 additional supporting documents

TOOLS PROVIDED:

- BUILD.bat - Automated build with verification
- Test-UTF8BOM.ps1 - PowerShell verification utility
- Testing\UTF8BOMVerifier.cs - C# verification class

TESTING:

✅ No compilation errors
✅ All null safety verified
✅ UTF-8 BOM confirmed present (EF BB BF)
✅ SSRS compatibility tested
✅ Field display verified
✅ Page layout verified

READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
